Without package.lock.json, there could be some discrepancies in installed versions in various settings. 
To address this difficulty, package.lock.json is generated to have the same results in any environment. 
It should be in source control with the package.json file so if any other user will clone the project and install dependencies
 then it will install the exact same dependencies as in package.lock.json to prevent discrepancies. 

Without package-lock.json, your package may exist.
